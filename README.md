2. Francois Chollet-Deep Learning with Python-Manning Publications (2017)
3. Aurélien Géron - Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow_ Concepts, Tools, and Techniques to Build Intelligent Systems (2019, O’Reilly Media)
4. Dive into Deep Learning - Interactive deep learning book with code, math, and discussions : https://d2l.ai/

Implemented with NumPy/MXNet, PyTorch, and TensorFlow

## Videos/Courses - DL 

## PyTorch Tutorials Online
1. https://pytorch.org/tutorials/
2. https://pytorch.org/resources/
3. https://github.com/hunkim/PyTorchZeroToAll
4. https://lelon.io/blog/pytorch-baby-steps
5. https://pytorchlightning.ai/ - "The ultimate PyTorch research framework. Scale your models, without the boilerplate."


## Specialize - Reinforcement Learning
### Books
1. Reinforcement Learning by Richard Sutton and Andrew Barto. [reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/7ui8jv/d_where_to_start_learning_reinforcement_learning/)
2. David Silver's RL Course. (here)[https://www.davidsilver.uk/teaching/]
3. Github repository of algorithms implemented in both Sutton's book and Silver's course. (here)[https://github.com/dennybritz/reinforcement-learning]
### Frameworks
1. RoboSuite by Google https://robosuite.ai/
2. OpenAI-Gym integration in Unreal Engine 4 https://github.com/zfw1226/gym-unrealcv
3. Microsoft AirSim https://microsoft.github.io/AirSim/
4. Quadrotor/Drone Simulator by UZH-RPG https://uzh-rpg.github.io/flightmare/
### Tutorials
1. https://github.com/bentrevett/pytorch-rl
2. https://github.com/jingweiz/pytorch-rl
3. https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/reinforcement_q_learning.html
4. https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/pytorch_with_examples.html - Neural network and Backprop/Optimization implemented in Numpy first, then refactored into Pytorch. Good tuturial especially the Numpy portion for a concept check.
